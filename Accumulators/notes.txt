Primarily used with Spark low level APIs.

Accumulator:
    Global mutable variable
    Can update them on row basis
    Can be used to implement counters and sums

We can use accumulator inside a transformation or action.

It is recommended to use inside an action since Spark may run the task 
multiple times if there was a failure or task taking longer.


Accumulators in PySpark are not visible in UI.
Named accumulators in scala are visible in UI.

Long and Float are allowed to be created as accumulators.
We can create custom accumulators as well.
